<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jaime Weingartner and I live in Wethersfield, CT with my wife Kate and our two kids Jake (age 14) and Bella (age 11). 
  I have been a business analyst for a little over 14 years and have worked in the healthcare industry for the same amount of years.
</p>

<p>I am actively pursuing a career change as a web developer and am currently taking classes via Udemy.com.  In my spare time I enjoy activities 
  such as biking, swimming, traveling, walking our two dogs Lexi (Age 5) and Cooper (Age 9 months).  I also try to get to the gym as often as I can. 
  Some of the places I've travelled to in my life thus far are Mexico, California, Florida, Italy, France, Peru, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas,
  and I'm sure a few others.
</p>

<p>One of the primary reasons why I'm seeking a career change is because as I mentioned I've been a business analyst a long time and I no longer get the same level
  of enjoyment in my work as I did when I first started.  Not to mention, I've always enjoyed coding over the years I've taken courses in SQL, VBA, and now Web Development.
  I recall back in college spending hours in the computer lab creating personal websites and the time would just pass by and I would be having a great time just coding.  I still get
  pleasure in creating something and seeing it come to life and that is why I feel it is time for me to get back into Web Development and go back to getting enjoyment out of my work.  Besides
  if you are going to work for a good portion of your life, you should at least enjoy what you do, right?
